# milestone-project-1

INSPIRATION: 
For this project, I wanted to tackle doing a game where I could get it done whithin the allocated time and that it wasn't too complicated for me to tackle, so I thought Tic Tac Toe was a good option

CONTROLS AND HOW TO PLAY:
Instructions - The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Player one is X , and player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

Controls - use your mouse to click on the tiles

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
I used VSCode for my main IDE and Github codespace for a browser IDE. I was able to code the css and the html on my own, but when I got to the javascript, I had to resort to ChatGPT and YouTube tutorials as a resource to help me get unstuck and figure out how I should code the functionality

BUGS:
whenever someone clicks on a cell, the result would show up too early and wouldn't display the correct result. A workaround for this is to simply ignore the result text until the game is over or that the player is unable to click on another cell
