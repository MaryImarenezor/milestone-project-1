            The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Player one is X , and player 2 is O. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
            <br/>
